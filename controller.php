//Things I need to do in this file:


// set variables, including empty strings, like errorMsg. Single message at the top, but then specific error messages will be shown in the fields.
//
//
// get form data  
// remove any htmlspecialchars


//validate data


// remove unwanted characters; clean up the data - chapter 9
// remove percent signs
// remove dashes
// remove dollar signs
// keep period in amounts and percentages, but in the percentage, check where it's located because it has to convert to decimal anyway



// Make the savings section entirely PHP, so it shows only if there's extra payments?
